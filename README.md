# Bet

Angular/Firebase project which facilitates peer to peer betting. Use npm to run.

A user sees categories such as sports and politics which filter down into leagues and then events which contain a list of open user bets. An admin creates the events that can be bet on. Users fund their account by transferring money into our account, the platform manages balances, and users can then request deposits which are approved by admins (who needs trustless!).
